# Teamwork Mission Framework (TMF)

<img src="http://teamonetactical.com/logo_tmf_ca.png">

TMF is an open source, flexible and modular mission framework designed from the ground up for Arma 3's 3DEN editor.
We created TMF intending it to be easy to pick up, but rich with features. A mission maker enabler, allowing them to focus on mission design instead of peripherals.
The framework is addon based, keeping filesize down and ensuring that even old missions are up-to-date.

## Core Features:
- Extensive 3DEN integration
- Automatic ACRE2 radio allocation and powerful channel creator, with randomized frequencies
- Our own Spectator system, with support for highlighting positions of e.g. objectives
- Assign Gear with config-based loadouts - loadouts can exist in the mission and/or an addon for retroactive updates
- Hierarchal ORBAT integration with ingame map tracker
- Easy Briefing system with automatically generated pages for player loadout, ORBAT and radios
- Safe Start module
- Wave Spawner module that preserves waypoints, supports trigger activation and headless client
- Map Click Teleport module for group leaders

## Common Issues
- On dedicated servers the briefing files may not load - To fix the issue in server.cfg to add the `sqf` extension to the `allowedHTMLLoadExtensions` whitelist. For example `allowedHTMLLoadExtensions[] = {"htm","html","xml","txt","sqf"};`
